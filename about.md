# About
With experience in the formulation of nanocarrier-based chemotherapeutic medications, my objective is to continue
this line of work by exploring the use of advanced nanocarriers such as exosomes and genomic-based carriers.
Through this research, I aim to optimize the targeting and efficacy of these medications while minimizing their
potential side effects.
